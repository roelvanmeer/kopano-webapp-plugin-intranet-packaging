## Good to know
It is not possible to open a website that has a different protocol as the WebApp itself. E.g. it is not possible to open a webpage that starts with https when the WebApp runs under http.
Some sites, e.g. https://google.com don't allow browser to load them in an iframe, therfore it is not possible to use these sites with this plugin.
